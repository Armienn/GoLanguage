// concept - can have a do'er (event) or can have a be'er (property) - nope, scratch
// concept - (event) can have a do'er and a be'er, (property) can have a be'er
// ^ i.e. substitute subject with do'er and be'er
// (jump) core: to jump - be'er: a jump - do'er: a jumper     ------  to be a jumper!?
// (jump) core: to be a jumper - be'er: a jumper - do'er: ?
// (eat) core: to eat - be'er: an instance of eating? - do'er: an eater
// (eat) core: to be an eater - be'er: an eater - do'er: ?
// (man) core: to be a man? the man-property? - be'er: a man - do'er: ?
// (love) core: to love - be'er: a love (en k√¶rlighed) - do'er: a lover (something that loves)
// (pretty) core: to be pretty? - be'er: a pretty something - do'er: ?
// (day) core: to be a day? - be'er: a day - do'er: ?

// when concept is used as descriptor, the described is a be'er of the concept
// when the descriptor is for a statement, the event descriped by the statement is the be'er of the descriptor (as in all other cases)

// a jump vs a jumper solution: a jump/to jump is the basic concept, and to construct the other meaning use expandedconcept thing
// ARGH. to jump vs to be a jump vs to be a jumper
// Or even: to give vs to be a giving vs to be a gift vs to be a giver vs to be a giftee
// It works: [man|beer] [jump|statement] - a man is a jump
// vs: [man|doer] [jump|statement] - a man jumps
// I'm an idiot
// It works: [man|beer] [[jump|verb][who|doer]|statement] - a man is a jumper (a man is one who jumps)
// vs: [man|doer] [jump|statement] - a man jumps
